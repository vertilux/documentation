All the documents submitted will be available for local printing.

These records are kept in our database and you can see it from your side as well as we can see them in our side, both, you and us, will have the same information available for that document.

All the approvals will be in the system and when approved, you will receive an e-mail with the approval for your records. In Any event, you can always PRINT the SCREEN to keep your records, should you have a difficult printing them in a normal way.

We are trying to set up the items we purchase from you, this information will include:

1. The packing, as prearranged with us, depending on the type of product, however, for components, this quantity must be exactly the same every single time. Shipments must be of complete boxes or bags as prearranged with us.
2. The Weights, Net Weight and Gross Weight, these two must be the same always per unit of measure \(UOM\).The total will be calculated by multiplying the quantity \(per pack to obtain the line weights, or total for the grand total per item\) times the Unit Weight.The only exclusion would be the aluminum extrusions since there are tolerances that will make the weight vary.
3. The UNIT PRICE. Once approved by both and established in the list, they cannot be changed unless it's approved by both.
