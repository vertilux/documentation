### Documents we request

* **Proforma Invoice:** A pro forma invoice is a preliminary bill of sale sent to buyers \(Vertilux\) in advance of a shipment or delivery of goods. The invoice will typically describe the purchased items and other important information such as the shipping weight and transport charges.
* **Packing List:** A packing list is a document that includes details about the contents of a package. The packing list is intended to let transport agencies, government authorities, and customers know the contents of the package. These details help each of these parties handle the package accordingly.
* **Commercial Invoice:** The commercial invoice is a legal document between the supplier and the customer that clearly describes' the sold goods, and the amount due on the customer. The commercial invoice is one of the main documents used by customs in determining customs duties.
* **Importer Security Filing \(ISF\):** An ISF, also known as “10+2,” is a filing required by the CBP that documents importing information and details, as shipments pass from point to point. Importers who do not file the ISF properly prior to the shipment of their goods will be penalized \(US$5,000 fine\).
* **Bill of Lading:** A bill of lading is a document issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment.

All the documents submitted will be available for local printing.

These records are kept in our database for a long time and you can see it from your side as well as we can see them in our side, both, you and us, will have the same information available for that document.

All the approvals will be in the system and when approved, you will receive an e-mail with the approval for your records. In Any event, you can always PRINT the SCREEN to keep your records, should you have a difficult printing them in a normal way.

We are trying to set up the items we purchase from you, this information will include:

1. The packing, as prearranged with us, depending on the type of product, however, for components, this quantity must be exactly the same every single time. Shipments must be of complete boxes or bags as prearranged with us.
2. The Weights, Net Weight and Gross Weight, these two must be the same always per unit of measure \(UOM\).The total will be calculated by multiplying the quantity \(per pack to obtain the line weights, or total for the grand total per item\) times the Unit Weight.The only exclusion would be the aluminum extrusions since there are tolerances that will make the weight vary.
3. The UNIT PRICE.  Once approved by both and established in the list, they cannot be changed unless its approved by both.
